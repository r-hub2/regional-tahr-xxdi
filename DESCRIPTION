Description: The package offers functionality to compute two novel indices: the x-index and the xd-index. 
  The x-index evaluates an institution's scholarly expertise within a specific discipline or field, 
  while the xd-index provides a broader assessment of overall scholarly expertise considering an institution's 
  publication pattern and strengths across coarse thematic areas. These indices offer a nuanced understanding of 
  institutional research capabilities, aiding stakeholders in research management and resource allocation decisions.
